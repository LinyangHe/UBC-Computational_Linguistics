The number of the input nodes is the number of syllables of the longest word. And that is the same to the output nodes.
For input, if the n th syllable is a long vowel, then the n th node's value is 1, otherwise, is 0. If n is bigger than the syllable length but smaller than the longest one, we give the vaules zeros.
For output, if the n th syllable is a stress, then the n th node's value is 1, otherwise, is 0. For the other nodes, it's the same to the input nodes.
